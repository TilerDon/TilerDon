- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TilerDon


 I've been programming since 1969 when I worked on a mainframe computer whick had 8K of memory , no disk, no magnetic tape and no printer. All input and output was 
 on paper tape. I do post date writing in machine code though,  although I did use it for fun on mimi-computers in the early 1980's. I started with Algol 60 then proceded
 onto COBOL and a couple of Assembler Languages then onto FORTRAN, Commercial FORTRAN and PICK/DataBASIC. I dabbled in Visual BASIC. 
 
 Object oriented programming is something that never featured for me and I still haven't come fully to terms with it.
 
 I'm nearly 73 and retired so I'm just playing around these days to keep my mind active.
 
 Just over 2 years ago I bought myself an Arduino and fairly quickly learned enough of the Arduino IDE to build and program a temperature controlled slide to
 shut off the 4 inch ventilation hole required for my log burner. It uses the mechanism from a DVD Player which has had the holes in the slide filled in, this is mounted 
 in a flat box that covers the ventilation hole through the wall. Connected to this box is a smaller enclosure housing a temperature sensor. This is positioned in the proximity 
 of the flue. I used a UTP cable to connect the slide box back to the Arduino. Once the temperature recorded by the sensor exceeds normal ambient temperature and is continuously
 rising, the vent opens. When the temperature starts to fall continuously or is below the threshold temperature the slide closes. The slide can be put into a manual mode by means
 of an IR remote control and then can be opened and closed as desired using the remote. Alternatively it can be set to Summer mode when the slide will stay open. 
 
 Amazingly in 2 years the unit has not failed although Heath Robertson describes its contruction more accurately than prototype and it saves a lot in fuel costs as it often 
 precludes the need to light the fire because of the cold air that would otherwise be blowing through the vent.
 
 Recently I found Processing 3 and its ability to communicate with the Arduino and I set off on a new journey.
 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in too many things because I find that I need to know so much in order to deliver some of the things I have in my mind.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Processing 3 and XML and how to use GITHub to better control my own development processes ...
